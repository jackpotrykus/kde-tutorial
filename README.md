This repo provides code to calculate a kernel density estimate (using the Gaussian kernel) without using any packages, so that someone reading through the code for the first time might (with the help of a textbook) better understand the logic behind choosing an optimal bandwidth *h*, and the rest of the math behind kernel density estimates.
